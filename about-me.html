  <h2>Hi everyone</h2>
  <p>I am Thai Huynh. Don't try to say it with the "th" phonic.. then it will be "thigh" :-) which is not right. Think "tie one on". There, you got it.

I coded with a middleware called coldfusion (Links to an external site.) for a few years many years ago. I then got more into databases (SQL/Oracle). So yes, I am more on the data layer than presentation layer. For the past 5 years I spend more time with Tableau (Links to an external site.) as an data analyst for Seattle-area airplane manufacturer. Just when I thought I've put web dev safely behind me, it found me again. And I found myself without my buddies who focused on front-end while I designed databases and coded coldfusion. So here I am... dusting myself and learning HTML5/CSS and most importantly Javascript. I hope to continue on and learn jQuery.

What I hope to get out of this class is be more proud of my websites when my users give more than 3-second attention span.

I think the most exciting about web development is seeing people using/sharing less and less MS Office documents as "web pages."

Our family used to have a dalmation. We had good memories. Kids are growing and moving out and I am pick up more and more time-consuming priorities ... no quality time to offer to any pets.

Nice to meet you!</p>
